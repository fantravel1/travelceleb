## 🌍 Overview

**TravelCeleb.com** is a global, multilingual, static-content platform documenting **where travel influencers really go, what they do there, and how their journeys unfold over time**—with clarity, verification, and context.

This is not influencer gossip.  
It is a **creator-travel intelligence and pattern-mapping platform**.

Coverage includes:
- Top destinations, locations, and activities featured by travel influencers
- City, region, and venue-level mappings
- Multi-stop journeys (“follow your favorite influencer”)
- Seasonal and thematic travel patterns
- Clear separation between sponsored vs organic travel (when verifiable)

No fake itineraries.  
No undisclosed hype.  
No private or real-time tracking.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

TravelCeleb is **not a social feed**.  
It is a **structured creator-travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- extract locations & activities from public content
- assemble journey timelines
- translate creator context
- cluster trends and themes

Humans are required to:
- verify accuracy & sponsorship disclosure
- prevent harassment or tracking
- approve journey reconstructions
- respect creator boundaries

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

TravelCeleb is built around **creator-centric travel entities**.

### Core Entities
- Influencer / Creator
- Destination
- Location / Venue
- Activity
- Journey
- Travel Theme
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links across creators, places, and time
- is programmatically generatable
